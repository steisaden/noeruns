# Feature Specification: 918 Runs: Registration and Motivation Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-what-i-m`  
**Created**: 2025-09-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "# WHAT I‚Äôm Building A single-page, mobile-first web platform for **918 Runs**, a Tulsa-based girls‚Äô basketball training program. It‚Äôs a **registration + motivation engine**: players (grades 6-12) sign up for Sunday sessions, upload highlight clips, and receive **personalized newsletters** that match the skills they said they want to improve. The entire stack is open-source and deploys free: GitHub Pages for the front end, Render for the tiny Node layer, no paid databases. # WHY I‚Äôm Building It 1. **Replace the Instagram DM chaos** ‚Äì coaches currently juggle RSVPs, waivers, and video clips in DMs; one link ends the mess. 2. **Capture data the program never had** ‚Äì parent contacts, emergency info, and *self-declared goals* are now structured and searchable. 3. **Automate encouragement** ‚Äì the newsletter tool turns each girl‚Äôs goals (‚Äúbetter left-hand finish‚Äù, ‚Äúlock-down defense‚Äù) into automatic weekly challenges, quotes, and drill videos. 4. **Showcase growth** ‚Äì the masonry gallery lets players see themselves improving week-to-week, fueling retention and word-of-mouth. 5. **Zero budget, zero vendor lock-in** ‚Äì built with Warp + MCPs, themed strictly to the logo colors, and hosted for free so every dollar stays on the court, not in SaaS fees."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A basketball player (grades 6-12) can easily sign up for training sessions, share their highlight videos, and get personalized tips to improve their game, while coaches can manage the program without the hassle of DMs.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a player is on the 918 Runs website, **When** they fill out the registration form for a Sunday session, **Then** they are confirmed for that session and the coach is notified.
2. **Given** a player is logged in, **When** they upload a video file, **Then** the video is added to their profile and appears in the public gallery.
3. **Given** a player has set their improvement goals, **When** the weekly newsletter is sent, **Then** it contains challenges, quotes, and videos relevant to their goals.
4. **Given** a coach is logged in, **When** they view the roster, **Then** they see all registered players' contact and emergency information.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a player tries to register for a session that is full?
- How does the system handle video uploads that fail or are in an unsupported format?
- What happens if a player has no specific goals set? What does their newsletter contain?
- What if the external sources for drill videos are unavailable?
